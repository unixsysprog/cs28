    Makefile    -- the makefile
    Plan        -- a description of the design and operation of my code
    typescript  -- a sample run

    alarmlib.c - timers for a high resolution clock
    alarmlib.h - exposes settime and millisleep functions

    ball.c     - contains data and movement logic related to the ball
    ball.h     - defines structs for ball and exposes ball_init method
    
    court.c    - contains the data and drawing logic for the court and
                 drawing logic when a ball leaves the court
    court.h    - defines court and court_timer structs and exposes the
                 court_init, court_round_over and update_timer functions

    paddle.c   - defines data and logic for moving and drawing the paddle
    paddle.h   - defines the struct for the paddle and exposes paddle_init,
                 paddle_move, and paddle_contact functions

    main.c     - instantiates the curses library, initializes all of the game
